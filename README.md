# AgriHealth Alert
*(Veterinary Telemedicine App)*

## Pitch
Farmers often face uncertainty when animals show unusual symptoms. Calling a veterinarian on site for every case can be costly and time-consuming. **AgriHealth Alert** provides a streamlined platform for **direct communication between farmers and veterinary professionals**, helping farmers manage herd health efficiently while supporting veterinarians in planning and response.

Farmers can quickly upload photos, a short description of symptoms and answer some overall multiple choice questions. They then receive feedback from veterinary professionals. The app also allows authorities to post news and alerts, making it an official channel for veterinary and animal health updates. All reports are stored, creating a rich database for future analysis and potential use by authorities.
