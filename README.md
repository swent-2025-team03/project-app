AgriHealth Alert

(Veterinary Telemedicine and Rapid Disease Reporting for Farmers)

Pitch

 Farmers often face uncertainty when animals show unusual symptoms. Calling a veterinarian for every case can be costly and time-consuming, while delays in reporting contagious diseases can worsen outbreaks. AgriHealth Alert combines veterinary telemedicine with rapid outbreak response. Farmers can quickly upload photos and a short description of symptoms and receive feedback from veterinary professionals. In normal use, this supports affordable, fast veterinary guidance. In the event of a suspected highly contagious animal disease outbreak, veterinary professionals can escalate reports to competent authorities, enabling rapid situational awareness, resource allocation, and containment measures. The app provides a professional, structured communication channel that strengthens both daily herd health management and emergency disease surveillance.
Features
Photo upload with GPS coordinates for precise reporting


Short symptoms report (number of animals, duration, severity, optional notes)


Veterinary feedback loop: professionals review and respond to farmer submissions


Crisis escalation: urgent cases flagged to authorities for investigation and containment


Map visualization of reported cases (only for canton veterinary)


Privacy management: farmers choose whether their reports are public; authorities retain full oversight


Offline mode: reports can be drafted without Internet and auto-sent when connectivity is restored


Requirements
Split App Model: Local storage for reports and offline functionality; profiles, history, and outbreak data stored in Firebase


User Support: Three roles — farmers (submit reports, receive vet advice), veterinary professionals (review regional cases, escalate), veterinary authorities (monitor pertinent reports, manage crisis data)


Sensor Use: Camera for photos, GPS for outbreak localization


Offline Mode: Farmers and vets can create and review reports offline, with syncing when online
Usage Examples
A pack of wolves attacks a farmer’s sheep. The farmer posts an alert to inform nearby farmers and simultaneously requests veterinary assistance. The veterinarian can advise on immediate care and, if necessary, escalate the situation to authorities.


A farmer notices unusual skin lesions on his cows. He sends a private report to a nearby veterinarian, who can either visit to provide treatment guidance or escalate the case to authorities if a contagious disease is suspected.


During routine observation, a farmer notices several chickens with respiratory distress. He uploads photos and a brief symptom report through the app. Veterinary professionals review the case and provide immediate advice, while simultaneously monitoring for potential outbreak patterns in the region.


Further Improvements
Introduce a guest mode for the general public, allowing them to view (only) what authorities authorize.


Allow the public to submit observations they believe may be relevant, such as sightings of dead wild animals, which could help authorities and farmers monitor emerging risks.


Implement push notifications for nearby farmers when a contagious disease is reported, improving situational awareness and response time.


Integrate automated alerts and analytics for veterinarians and authorities to identify clusters of unusual symptoms quickly.
