# AgriHealth Alert
*(Veterinary Telemedicine and Herd Health Management for Farmers)*

## Pitch
Farmers often face uncertainty when animals show unusual symptoms. Calling a veterinarian for every case can be costly and time-consuming. **AgriHealth Alert** provides a streamlined platform for **direct communication between farmers and veterinary professionals**, helping farmers manage herd health efficiently while supporting veterinarians in planning and response.

Farmers can quickly upload photos and a short description of symptoms and receive timely feedback from veterinary professionals. The app also allows authorities to post news and alerts, making it an official channel for veterinary and animal health updates. All reports are stored, creating a rich database for future analysis and potential use by authorities.

## Features
- **Photo upload with GPS coordinates** for accurate case reporting  
- **Short symptom reports** (number of animals affected, duration, severity, optional notes)  
- **Veterinary feedback loop**: vets review and respond directly to farmer submissions  
- **Planning and scheduling tools** for veterinarians to manage farm visits and consultations  
- **News & alerts**: official updates from authorities for farmers and vets  
- **Privacy management**: farmers choose whether reports are shared publicly or kept private  
- **Offline mode**: draft reports without Internet; auto-send when back online

## Usage Examples
- A farmer notices unusual skin lesions on cows. They upload photos and a brief report to a vet, who provides guidance on treatment and schedules a follow-up visit.  
- During routine checks, a farmer observes chickens with respiratory distress. They send a report to a veterinarian, who replies with care instructions and plans an on-site inspection.  
- Authorities post a region-wide alert about a local outbreak of a contagious animal disease. Farmers receive the official news, while vets can prepare for preventive visits.

## Further Improvements

- **Public reporting of observations** (e.g., dead wild animals) to assist monitoring  
- **Push notifications** for farmers when vets respond or when official news is posted  
- **Analytics tools** for veterinarians to monitor symptom trends across farms
