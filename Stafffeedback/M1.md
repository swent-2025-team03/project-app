# SwEnt M1 Team Grading Report

This first milestone M1 serves as a checkpoint at which we provide you with formal feedback on how you are coming together as a team, organizing yourselves, adopting good software engineering practices, and making progress toward delivering incremental value to your users. This is meant to complement the informal, ungraded feedback from your coaches given during the weekly meetings or asynchronously on Discord, email, etc.

The goal of our evaluation is not to assess whether you are top-tier Android developers or software testers, this will be assessed in earnest in subsequent milestones, once you've had the opportunity to gain experience and acquire the relevant skills. You can find the evaluation criteria in the [M1 Deliverables](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/M1.md) document.


## Blue Belt

You qualified for a Blue Belt ðŸ¥‹ðŸ”µ and got a final grade of 5.37/6 for M1. Excellent work! You're demonstrating advanced skills. 

We looked at several aspects, grouped into five categories. Here is the breakdown of the points you earned:

| **Final Grade**                 | **5.37 out of 6**    |            |                                           |


In addition to the feedback you received from the coaches during the Sprints, you will find some extra feedback below.

## Implementation (APK, CI, tests)

We looked at whether your APK is functional and reliable. We also assessed your repo setup, whether it is clearly organized and if there is a CI running Sonar Cloud and running tests including at least one meaningful end-to-end test.

The APK is functional, we didn't find any major bug or crash. The functionality is quite minimal for now. It also lacks google authentication and reactivity when going into landscape mode.
- Sonar is correctly integrated in the repo
- The tests are run by the CI
- There is at least one meaningful end-to-end test
- The line coverage on M1 code is 63,4

Repo is setup, conventions are clear. CI is good. A few branches don't respect naming conventions (for example: Feature/firebase auth tests #83 should be test/firebase auth tests #83), but overall consistent.

For this part, you received 4.43 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog

We assessed the structure and clarity of your Sprint and Product Backlogs and how you used them.
We looked at whether your tasks are well defined, appropriately sized, and aligned with user stories; whether the Product Backlog is well organized and value-driven; and whether the Sprint Backlog is continuously updated and demonstrates good planning and prioritization.

Great Sprint Backlog. Tasks have an assignee, a priority and all necessary tags. They also have an additional description if necessary.

The Product Baklog is also great. It shows the prioritization of user stories.

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Figma

We evaluated your Figma, whether it is up-to-date with the app and how it is used as a communication, planning and design tool to accelerate the implementation of good UI.

Very good and structured Figma. It will allow you to implement UI that has a coherent identity accross screens. It's also nice that you have the wireframes, everything is very clear.

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Architecture

We reviewed your projectâ€™s architecture diagram, whether it is up-to-date with the app and if it follows clean design principles. We also looked at how it is used to discuss and document the architecture of the app as the app evolves.

Very clear architecture diagram. The architecture is also good.

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Scrum Process Documents

We reviewed your Scrum process documentation, including Sprint Retrospectives and Team Standup. We assessed whether they documented the process in detail, and how they were used to prepare the meetings. We also looked at your ability to lead structured and effective meetings, with everyone's participation.

Team Scrum documents are filled and detailed. The Sprint 2 retrospective show a great ability to identify issues and self correct from your team. We expect to see all of the changes applied during Sprint 3!

For this part, you received 6 points out of a maximum of 6.

## Summary

Your team grade for milestone M1 is 5.37. If you are interested in how this fits into the bigger grading scheme, please see [project README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/project/README.md) and the [course README](https://github.com/swent-epfl/public/blob/main/README.md).

Your coaches will be happy to discuss the above feedback in more detail.

Good luck for the next Sprints!
